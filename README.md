## 🧭 Overview

**IskoArena** is a modular platform that enables universities or organizations to manage sporting events efficiently.  
It supports:
- Centralized **admin dashboards** for scheduling, analytics, and standings.
- Real-time **mobile updates** for players, fans, and organizers.
- Seamless data synchronization across distributed services.

## 🏗️ Architecture

![IskoArena Architecture](./9934a621-a009-41f6-a680-c3341fe9f8f1.png)

The platform follows a **microservices-based architecture** deployed across **Vercel (Frontend)** and **Dockerized Node.js services** for backend APIs.  
A **Kafka message broker** handles asynchronous communication between admin and mobile backends.

### Key Layers
1. **Frontend Clients**
   - **Admin UI (React + Tailwind)**: Used by organizers for scheduling, analytics, and management.
   - **Mobile Client (Flutter)**: Used by players and fans to view live scores, standings, and notifications.

2. **API Gateway**
   - Acts as a unified entry point for both admin and mobile clients.
   - Handles authentication, routing, and load balancing between services.

3. **Microservices**
   - **Admin Backend**: Game scheduling, live score input, analytics, authentication.
   - **Mobile Backend**: Consumes Kafka topics to display real-time updates and notifications.
   - **Analytics Service**: Processes and aggregates player and game data for dashboards and leaderboards.

4. **Message Broker**
   - **Kafka** manages real-time topics:
     - `games_schedules_topic`
     - `live_scores_topic`
     - `updates_topic`

5. **Databases**
   - PostgreSQL for persistent storage:
     - Schedules
     - Standings
     - Player data
     - Authentication

6. **Hosting**
   - **Frontend:** Deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
   - **Backend:** Dockerized Node.js microservices
   - **Database:** PostgreSQL (managed instance or containerized)
   - **Message Broker:** Apache Kafka

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Admin UI** pushes updates → API Gateway → Admin Microservices.  
2. **Microservices** publish updates to **Kafka topics** (`games_schedules`, `live_scores`, `updates`).  
3. **Mobile Backend** consumes Kafka messages → updates Postgres → serves mobile clients.  
4. **Analytics service** periodically aggregates results → dashboards.
